                    <p class="text-justify mtm">
                        Started its humble beginning through the effort of the late Rolando Carlos Sr. (founder).
                        Using Rolando's expertise in interior designing, he created a family-owned business in 1975 under a different company name,
                        QuaSer (Quality Service) providing expertise in window treatment and upholstery in the Philippines. In 1988, his wife, Gloria Carlos,
                        took over the family business which turned into the company name Glo's Decor and opened a small shop in Manila, Philippines.
                        <br><br>
                        Today, under a new name, Excellent Home Decor (EHD), the legacy of quality service still runs in the family business.
                        EHD is under the professional leadership of Rolando's children and grandsons.  Over the years, EHD is still developing its skills and
                        knowledge in the field of interior designing from window treatment, to  upholstery, to furniture, to design development, to installation
                        and motorize system. EHD provides outstanding window treatment products and excellent service to our clients.
